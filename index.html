  <section id="about" class="container mb-5">
    <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#17a2b8;">About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a passionate PC gaming enthusiast who loves diving into immersive worlds and staying up-to-date with the latest in gaming technology.</p>
    <p>When I’m not gaming, you’ll often find me playing guitar, exploring new sounds, and enjoying the creative expression that music brings.</p>
    <p>I firmly believe in maintaining a student mentality throughout life—there’s always something new to learn, whether it’s emerging technology or ways to improve personally and professionally.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="experience" class="container mb-5">
    <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#17a2b8;">Experience</h2>
    <p>I bring a diverse technical background shaped by hands-on academic and professional experience. In my current role as a Network Operations Center Engineer at Humana, I proactively monitor enterprise networks, analyze anomalies, and work to ensure 24/7 infrastructure integrity. My time at Microsoft as a Global Inside Partner Development Manager sharpened my skills in cloud architecture, compliance communication, and stakeholder engagement for SaaS and Azure portfolios exceeding $700,000 annually.</p>
    <p>My academic work has allowed me to design and document entire security frameworks for simulated business environments, including data protection plans, password management policies, and patch management schedules. I’ve conducted vulnerability assessments using tools like Nessus and Metasploit, and implemented network segmentation, firewalls, and secure remote access policies as part of cybersecurity architecture projects. These hands-on opportunities gave me experience that translates directly to enterprise-level environments.</p>
    <p>Whether building out security documentation for eCommerce organizations or auditing systems against NIST 800-53 and PCI DSS standards, I’ve developed a balanced skill set combining technical execution with policy understanding. I’m focused on driving cybersecurity maturity and continuous improvement across every environment I engage with.</p>
