    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate PC gaming enthusiast who loves diving into immersive worlds and staying up-to-date with the latest in gaming technology.
      When I’m not gaming, you’ll often find me playing guitar, exploring new sounds, and enjoying the creative expression that music brings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe in maintaining a student mentality throughout life—there’s always something new to learn, whether it’s emerging technology, fresh perspectives, or ways to improve personally and professionally.
      I’m also a dedicated family man, cherishing the time I spend with my wife and kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a deep curiosity for new technology, I love exploring innovations and how they shape the world around us.
      Whether it’s gaming, music, or tech, I’m always eager to learn, grow, and connect with like-minded individuals.
    </p>
