      This was one of my early programming projects, originally built in C# using Windows Forms. Recently, I revisited and updated it as a fun way for my kids to explore creativity through storytelling.
      It now includes a polished GUI, the ability to export stories to a formatted `.txt` file, and a self-contained Windows executable.

      It's a simple but fun example of how code and imagination can come together. Whether you're trying it solo or with your kids, the Story Generator makes it easy to create something quirky and unique.
